# Layout

This folder contains a layout management system. It includes the system that allows panels to be repositioned, but not the contents of the panels.
There are a couple of dependencies to utilities outside this directory, but it's mostly self-contained. I would like to release this as a standalone package eventually, in order to use this same system in other projects.
